Lab 5A: Track Expenses Using Character Arrays (C String)
 
Objectives:
• Perform C string manipulations
• Understand how to manipulate data using arrays
• Handle input errors and invalid values
• Design and create a well-structure program using C++ basic programming constructs
 
Description:
Write a menu-driven program that provides the following options:
1. Show All
2. Spend
3. Search expenses containing this string
4. Search expenses with greater than or equal to this amount
5. Exit
It allows the user to select a menu option to display all expenses, add new entry, search for a substring and find the list of entries greater a given amount.
 
Requirements:
1. The program must produce similar output as example below. The output should be formatted nicely as given.
2. The program must use array of structs
3. The program must not use global variables. In another words, it must use local variables and pass-by-value or pass-by-reference parameters.
4. The expense struct must use character array (C++ string is NOT allowed).
5. You should not use data file to save or read from. All operations should be done through the use of arrays and array indices.
6. You must write at least 2 functions.
 
Required error handling:
The program MUST perform the following checks:
1. Check for invalid amount (negative or 0 number)
2. Description cannot be empty.
3. Search is case-insensitive (ignore case, but the user may type in any case).
